# Process Builder Knowledge Base — Safe Taxonomies (Dropdown Options) (v1)
This document provides **safe, generic** option lists that can be used without inventing company-specific facts.

## When to use a dropdown
Use a dropdown field only if:
- the options come from this taxonomy list, OR
- the options come from an org-specific tool/knowledge base.

If neither is available, use a free-text field instead of guessing.

## Common taxonomies

### Leave Type
- Annual
- Sick
- Personal
- Unpaid
- Bereavement
- Maternity / Paternity
- Work From Home

### Request Priority
- Low
- Medium
- High
- Urgent

### Notification Channel
- Email
- Slack
- Microsoft Teams
- SMS

### Approval Outcome (when modeled as user input)
- Approve
- Reject

## Notes
- **Departments** are not universal. Do NOT invent a department list unless an org-specific source exists.
- If an org has a tool or knowledge base that contains a department list, use it.
